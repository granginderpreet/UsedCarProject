# UsedCarProject

# First the business objective was provided for the project. Then the data was analyzed and cleaned. Followed by generating a model and estimating the MSE. Then the data was modified by filtering the data for particular model and the model was rerun. 

# Conclusion: It seems that having a model based on a "manufacturer" was better than having a model to cover all manufacturers. Also due to lack of data for other features, we chose to use "odometer" and "year" of make as input to the model.
